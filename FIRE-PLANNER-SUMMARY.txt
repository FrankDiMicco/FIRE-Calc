FIRE PLANNER - PROJECT SUMMARY
================================

VISION
------
Comprehensive, modular FIRE planning tool that integrates budget, taxes, ACA subsidies, 
retirement simulations, and portfolio strategy - all working standalone OR connected together.


CORE MODULES
------------
1. Budget Builder (foundation - feeds other tools)
2. Years to FI Calculator
3. Retirement Simulator (historical + Monte Carlo)
4. Bucket Strategy Builder
5. Tax Calculator
6. ACA Subsidy Calculator
7. Roth Conversion Optimizer
8. Withdrawal Strategy Comparison
9. Integrated Dashboard


UI APPROACH
-----------
- Card-based dashboard (mobile-first)
- Each card opens a full module
- Visual indicators for connected tools (🔗)
- Touch-optimized, works great on phone/tablet/desktop
- Clean, modern interface with gradient backgrounds


DATA & TECH STACK
-----------------
✓ Validated Shiller historical data (1871-2024)
  - Annual stock returns (nominal)
  - Annual bond returns (nominal)
  - Annual inflation (CPI)
  - Matches FICalc results within 0.62%

- localStorage for data persistence (survives browser refresh)
- Optional integration between modules
- Export/Import/Clear All functionality
- PWA-ready for "install to home screen"
- Capacitor for eventual iOS app conversion


MODULE INTEGRATION PHILOSOPHY
------------------------------
Users can:
- Use one tool independently (just ACA calculator, just budget, etc.)
- Connect multiple tools together for comprehensive planning
- See visual indicators of which tools are sharing data
- Import/export data between tools manually or automatically

Example integrations:
- Budget → Years to FI (auto-calculates FI number)
- Budget → Tax Calculator (knows spending needs)
- Tax Calculator → ACA Subsidy (shares MAGI calculation)
- All modules → Dashboard (comprehensive overview)


USER WORKFLOWS
--------------
Casual User:
  Start → Pick one card → Use tool → Done

Power User:
  Start → Budget → Years to FI → Retirement Simulator → 
  Tax Planning → ACA Optimization → Dashboard overview → 
  Adjust and re-run

Key Feature: NO FORCED WORKFLOW
- Every tool works independently
- Integration is optional and beneficial
- Clear visual feedback on connections


DATA PERSISTENCE
----------------
- Auto-save to localStorage on every change
- Survives browser refresh/close
- Export button creates downloadable JSON backup
- Import button restores from JSON file
- "Clear All Data" button in settings for fresh start
- (Future) Cloud sync with user accounts


PATH FORWARD
------------
Phase 1: Build web app with card dashboard
  - Implement card-based navigation
  - Create shared state manager
  - Build data import/export system

Phase 2: Implement core modules one at a time
  - Start with Budget Builder (foundation)
  - Add Years to FI Calculator
  - Add Retirement Simulator with Shiller data
  - Continue with remaining modules

Phase 3: Add integration layer
  - Module-to-module data sharing
  - Visual connection indicators
  - Dashboard that synthesizes all data

Phase 4: Polish and test
  - Mobile optimization
  - PWA features (offline, installable)
  - User testing and refinement

Phase 5: (Future) iOS app
  - Wrap with Capacitor
  - Build in Xcode
  - Submit to App Store


TECHNICAL BEST PRACTICES FOR FUTURE iOS
----------------------------------------
- Use relative units (rem, %, vh) not fixed pixels
- Touch targets minimum 44px (iOS standard)
- Avoid hover-dependent interactions
- Keep file paths relative
- Structure code in clean modules
- Use custom modals instead of alert()/confirm()
- Don't rely on browser-specific features


KEY DATA VALIDATION COMPLETED
------------------------------
✓ Shiller data extracted and formatted as JSON
✓ Tested against FICalc for 1980-2009 scenario:
  - Our result: $11,809,238
  - FICalc result: $11,736,406
  - Difference: 0.62% (excellent accuracy)
✓ Data includes:
  - 154 years of complete annual data (1871-2024)
  - Nominal stock returns (S&P 500 total return)
  - Nominal bond returns (10-year Treasury)
  - Inflation rates (CPI year-over-year)


STRETCH GOALS
-------------
- Native iOS app (via Capacitor)
- Cloud sync with user accounts
- Social Security integration
- Pension planning module
- Real estate investment tracking
- Multiple scenario comparison side-by-side
- PDF report generation
- Sharing retirement plans via URL


PROJECT FILES
-------------
- shiller_annual_data.json - Validated historical market data
- test_ficalc.py - Python simulator for testing against FICalc
- ui-prototype-cards.html - Card-based UI mockup
- ui-prototype-sidebar.html - Sidebar navigation mockup
- ui-prototype-topnav.html - Top navigation mockup


NOTES
-----
- Cards UI chosen for superior mobile experience
- Modular architecture allows independent use of tools
- localStorage sufficient for initial version (no backend needed)
- Web-first approach, iOS conversion comes later
- Focus on clean, simple UX - avoid overwhelming users
- Progressive disclosure: show simple options first, advanced later
